# 📸 Case Study: Designing Instagram

*"How to handle 2 billion users sharing 95 million photos and videos daily"*

## 🎓 Before We Start: Instagram in Simple Terms

### **What is Instagram, Really?** 🤔
```
Imagine a global photo album where:
- Anyone can upload photos and videos
- People can "follow" others to see their photos
- Photos appear in your personal feed
- You can like, comment, and share photos
- Everything happens instantly, everywhere in the world

The challenge: How do you make this work for 2 BILLION people uploading 95 million photos every day?
```

### **The Key Insight for Slow Learners** 💡
```
Instagram's main challenges:
1. Photo/Video Storage: Each photo is ~2MB, video is ~50MB
2. Global Distribution: Show photos instantly worldwide
3. Feed Generation: Show relevant photos to each user
4. Image Processing: Resize photos for different devices

Think about it:
- 95 million photos × 2MB = 190TB of new data EVERY DAY
- Must show photos to users in < 200ms globally
- Each user's feed is personalized based on who they follow
```

### **Learning Approach for This Case Study** 📚
```
🌱 Beginner: Focus on photo upload/download and basic feed
🌿 Intermediate: Understand CDN, image processing, and caching
🌳 Advanced: Dive into recommendation algorithms and global scaling

Key Instagram concepts:
- Media storage and CDN (different from text-based Twitter)
- Image processing pipeline
- Mobile-first design considerations
```

### **Key Questions to Keep in Mind** ❓
```
As you read this case study, ask yourself:
1. "How is storing photos different from storing text?"
2. "Why do photos load instantly even from other countries?"
3. "How does Instagram decide which photos to show me first?"
4. "What happens when I upload a photo?"
```

## 📋 Requirements Gathering

### **Functional Requirements** ✅
```
✅ Upload photos and videos
✅ Follow other users
✅ View personalized feed
✅ Like and comment on posts
✅ Search for users and hashtags
✅ Stories (24-hour temporary posts)
✅ Direct messaging
✅ Explore page (discover new content)
```

### **Non-Functional Requirements** 📊
```
📊 Scale: 
   - 2B registered users
   - 500M daily active users
   - 95M photos/videos uploaded daily
   - 4.2B likes per day
   - Available in 190+ countries

⚡ Performance:
   - Photo upload: < 10 seconds
   - Feed loading: < 200ms
   - Photo display: < 100ms
   - 99.9% availability

📱 Mobile-First:
   - 95% of users access via mobile
   - Support for slow networks
   - Offline viewing capabilities
```

### **Back-of-Envelope Calculations** 🧮
```
Daily Active Users: 500M
Photos per user per day: 0.2 (95M ÷ 500M)
Average photo size: 2MB
Average video size: 50MB
Video to photo ratio: 1:10

Daily Storage Needs:
- Photos: 85M × 2MB = 170TB/day
- Videos: 10M × 50MB = 500TB/day
- Total: 670TB/day = 244PB/year

Read/Write Ratio: 100:1 (Much more viewing than uploading)
Bandwidth: 500M users × 20 photos viewed × 2MB = 20PB/day
```

## 🚶‍♂️ Step-by-Step Walkthrough (Follow Along!)

### **Step 1: What Happens When You Upload a Photo?** 📸
```
1. You take a photo and hit "Share"
2. App compresses photo (2MB → 500KB for upload)
3. Photo uploaded to nearest server
4. Server generates multiple sizes:
   - Thumbnail (150×150)
   - Medium (640×640)  
   - Large (1080×1080)
   - Original (for profile owner)
5. All versions stored in global CDN
6. Photo metadata saved in database
7. Feed generation process begins for your followers

This entire process happens in under 10 seconds!
```

### **Step 2: What Happens When You Open Instagram?** 📱
```
1. You open Instagram app
2. App requests: "Show me the feed for this user"
3. Server thinks: "This user follows 500 people, let me get their recent photos"
4. Server fetches photos from followed users (from database)
5. Server applies ranking algorithm (which photos to show first)
6. Server returns list of photo URLs
7. App downloads photos from CDN (closest location to you)
8. Photos appear in your feed

Challenge: Steps 3-6 must happen in under 200ms!
```

### **Step 3: The Big Problems - Photos vs Text** 🎯
```
Text (Twitter): 280 characters = ~300 bytes
Photo (Instagram): Average = 2MB (6,600x larger!)

This creates unique challenges:
1. Storage: Need massive storage infrastructure
2. Bandwidth: Moving photos globally is expensive
3. Processing: Need to resize photos for different devices
4. Speed: Photos must still load instantly

2. Generate feed for users likely to open app soon
3. Store top 50 posts in Redis cache
4. Update cache when new posts from followed users

Real-time (for active users):
1. User opens app
2. Check for new posts since last visit
3. Merge with cached feed
4. Apply final ranking
5. Return top 20 posts for initial load

Hybrid Approach Benefits:
- Fast loading for most users
- Fresh content for active users
- Reduced computation costs
- Better user experience
